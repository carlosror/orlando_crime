## Motivation

I wanted an Orange County equivalent of [this Hillsborough County website](http://gis.hcso.tampa.fl.us/PublicGIS/CrimeMapping/), i.e., 
I wanted to be able to enter an O.C. address or landmark and get a plot of criminal activity within a given radius of that address/landmark.
Here I had access to the police calls data rather than the actual criminal activity.

## Technologies

[R](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming), [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [Shiny R server](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/), [Leaflet for R](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).

## Features

By default, the app plots the police calls in a 0.5 mile radius around a large intersection downtown:

You can enter a landmark in the search box, e.g., Lake Eola Park, and click Search:

You can also click on the map (outside the circle) and click Search and the app will return the police calls centered around the location.
Here you can see I clicked on the Lynx Central Station:
